        <h2>Tottenham</h2>
        <p>Ange Postecoglou paid tribute to Tottenham Hotspur striker Richarlison after his brace helped down
            Newcastle United 4-1 on Sunday and earned them their first victory since October 27.

            Spurs were Premier League leaders at the beginning of November, but had endured a barren run since after
            a succession of injuries and failed to win any of their last five matches despite taking the lead in
            each fixture.</p>
