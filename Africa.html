        <h2>Victoria falls</h2>
        <p>Outdoorsy types travel far and wide to admire this breathtaking UNESCO World Heritage Site.
            Straddling
            the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe in Mosi Oa Tunya National Park, Victoria Falls is roughly
            twice
            as deep and wide as Niagara Falls, making it one of the world's most jaw-dropping waterfalls. To see
            this natural wonder at its prime, plan a visit in April or May when the region's rainy season has
            concluded. Popular vantage points include the Knife-Edge Bridge, Livingstone Island and Devil's
            Pool.
            When you're not enjoying the view from above, go whitewater rafting in the Zambezi River to admire
            the
            falls from a different angle.</p>

        <h2>Serengeti National Park</h2>
        <p>"There's more to see than can ever be seen, more to do than can ever be done." When musicians Elton
            John
            and Tim Rice wrote the opening tune to Disney's "The Lion King," they were describing the "Circle of
            Life." But this lyric serves as a fitting description for world-renowned Serengeti National Park.
            This
            magnificent game park sprawls across 5,700 square miles of northern Tanzania in East Africa. When
            American hunter-turned-conservationist Stewart Edward White first set foot in the Serengeti in 1913,
            he
            described the journey: "We walked for miles over burnt out country. ... Then I saw the green trees
            of
            the river, walked two miles more and found myself in paradise."

            Within the boundaries of the Serengeti, you'll hear thousands of animals: Hyenas cackle as elephants
            trample well-worn safari roads and hippos splash in watering holes. And at any given time, more than
            2,000 lions are poised to pounce on unsuspecting prey, preparing to chase their unlucky target
            through
            the seemingly endless waves of golden grass. The scenery rustles with the swift steps of loping
            giraffes, and tree branches shake with every monkey's movement. But the most magical site you'll
            behold
            is The Great Migration, during which White's paradise is drowned by a sea of animals as more than
            one
            million wildebeest, zebras and gazelles traverse the Serengeti in search of greener pastures.</p>

        <h2>Mauritius</h2>
        <p>Mauritius appeals to vacationers in search of a bit of everything. Though its main draws are its
            powdery
            sands and luxe beach resorts, this small island nation east of Madagascar also charms visitors with
            its
            mix of cultures; friendly locals; lively festivals and tasty teas and rums. After a day of exploring
            some of the island's nature reserves and soaking up the sun, retreat to one of its premier
            properties to
            savor fresh seafood while watching a traditional sega dance performance or the sun set over the
            Indian
            Ocean.</p>
