        <h2>The Colosseum in Rome, Italy</h2>
        <p>Topping off the list of most popular tourist attractions is the Colosseum which is no big surprise for
            those with it on their bucket list.

            While a significant landmark in Rome, for those that have been & seen it in person, I must say that
            while impressive, it is not near as excellent a site as The Roman Forum </p>

        <h2>Swiss Alps</h2>
        <p>TLocated south of Zurich, Bern and Basel, the Swiss Alps are a haven for winter sports enthusiasts. While
            skiing, hiking and snowboarding tend to dominate this region, you'll also discover quaint towns, serene
            lakes and gorgeous scenery that can be experienced year-round. Luxury mountain resorts are available
            throughout the region as well, making it a playground for all sorts of travelers. Additionally, no trip
            to the Swiss Alps would be complete without indulging in some warm, gooey cheese fondue and
            melt-in-your-mouth Swiss chocolate.</p>

        <img class="NewsPics" src="body/Vienna.jpg" alt="Vienna">
        <h2>Vienna</h2>
        <p>History is at the heart of Vienna both literally and figuratively. The narrow streets of the Innere Stadt
            (Inner City) snake through antiquated buildings, providing an atmosphere so authentic that you almost
            expect a Vienna native like composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or psychologist Sigmund Freud to round a
            cobblestone corner and greet you with "guten tag." Extravagant baroque palaces from the Habsburg
            Monarchy loom over the city, just as Mozart's classical arias pour from contemporary cafes. If it's
            culture you seek, you'll find it here.

            But there's more to this city than just music and monarchs. Vienna is also a great place to spend some
            cash, with independent bookstores competing for business alongside haute couture. There are also a
            surprising number of attractions for young ones, including an amusement park and a top-notch zoo. And
            although many Viennese retire early in the night, that doesn't mean you have to; sneak out to one of the
            bars along the city's Bermuda Triangle, or drop by one of the wine taverns skirting the Vienna Woods.
