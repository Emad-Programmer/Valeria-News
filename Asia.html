        <h2>Top 3 Tourist Destinations in Asia</h2>
        <p>There are so many exciting top destinations in Asia, deciding where to go can be difficult; but that's a
            good problem to have.

            Don't despair! With cheap budget flights between major hubs in Asia, you could easily catch a couple or
            more of these tempting top-spots on a single trip. Regardless of where you begin, you'll have access to
            culture, UNESCO sites, nature, and exciting culinary treats.

            If planning your first big trip to Asia, consider a soft landing in one of these top destinations for
            first-time travelers.

        <h2>Chiang Mai,Thailand</h2>
        <p>From numerous cultural festivals and sprawling night markets to mountain trekking and scores of beautiful
            temples, Chiang Mai attracts over a million visitors a year who just can't wait to come back. Chiang Mai
            is certainly the most popular among the top 10 places to visit in Thailand.

            Pai, a riverside village only four hours north of Chiang Mai, is a bonus; you can visit both of them
            together as a "package."

            Although inflation is on the rise due to popularity (Bangkok is consistently one of the most visited
            cities in the world), a vacation in Thailand is still relatively inexpensive.</p>

        <h2>Penang, Malaysia</h2>
        <p>Known as the "Pearl of the Orient," Penang is a place to relax, eat delicious food to the brink of
            misery, and appreciate Malaysia in a new way. Malaysians are quite proud of their large island — and
            they should be!

            A legacy of immigration and colonization in Penang has produced what is arguably some of the best
            cuisines in all of Southeast Asia. Penang hawker food combines the best of Malay with influences from
            Chinese and Indian immigrants to produce mouthwatering creations.

            Superb food is not the only indulgence on the island. You'll find ​hip museums and art galleries along
            with plenty of other things to do in Penang. Georgetown may have some grubby edges, but it's not only
            charming, it's groovy.</p>

        <h2>Singapore</h2>
        <p>Notoriously expensive and often unfairly shunned by budget travelers afraid of getting fined, tiny
            Singapore is a modern-yet-green city/island/country well worth a visit for the food, mega-mall shopping,
            and unique blend of cultures.

            Don't assume that Singapore is all about concrete shopping blocks! You'll find ample green space and an
            impressive system of elevated biking and walking trails that interconnect city parks.

            Yes, Singapore costs far more than neighboring Malaysia or the rest of Southeast Asia, however, the city
            has a pleasant vibe, lively Indian and Chinese cultures, speaks good English, and is pleasant enough
            just to stroll. You could spend months living in Singapore and still discover hidden places and eateries
            the guidebooks have missed! Even the museums in Singapore will remain in memory forever.</p>
