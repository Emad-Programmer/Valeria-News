        <p>American tech giant Apple has been granted a patent for an external flashlight feature on future Apple
            Watches, potentially revolutionising how users navigate in low-light conditions.

            While current models include an integrated flashlight that illuminates the display, the upcoming upgrade
            aims to introduce a dedicated external flashlight on the watch bands, according to GSM Arena.

        <p>In January, Apple agreed to let its board oversee an independent audit of its US labor practices after
            five investors with $7 billion in company stock raised concerns about the unfair treatment of workers
            trying to unionize. Today, workers at two Apple Stores wrote to the company’s board claiming that Apple
            may be unfairly skewing the audit, by excluding workers at stores that have unionized. A report on the
            audit is due to be published by the end of the year.

        <p>Cut to 2023. Apple has spent the past three years upping the ante on power instead of design and as a
            result, the Mac has gotten boring again. Rather than shining a light on any exterior innovations this
            year, Apple recycled the chassis for the Mac Mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, focusing solely on pushing
            the boundaries of its house-made silicon and shattering any hopes that the iMac's most recent redo was
            the start of a new, vibrant era for Apple's machines.</p>

        <p>Microsoft Rewards Shareholders with Quarterly Dividend:
            Microsoft announced its latest quarterly dividend, rewarding shareholders with a steady stream of
            income. The dividend of $0.62 per share reflects the company's strong financial performance and
            commitment to returning value to its investors. This news is likely to be welcomed by dividend-seeking
            investors and further boost confidence in Microsoft's long-term prospects.</p>
