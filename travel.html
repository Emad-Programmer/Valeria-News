        <h2>Tourist Attractions in the World</h2>
        <p>
            According to Trip Advisor, Italy tops out as one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world,
            with three of the top 10 sites that people travel to! It is easy to see why with its rich history,
            architecture, museums, and of course, food!
            Chiang Mai, Thailand From numerous cultural festivals and sprawling night markets to mountain trekking
            and scores of beautiful
            temples, Chiang Mai attracts over a million visitors a year who just can't wait to come back. Chiang Mai
            is certainly the most popular among the top 10 places to visit in Thailand.

            Pai, a riverside village only four hours north of Chiang Mai, is a bonus; you can visit both of them
            together as a "package."

            Although inflation is on the rise due to popularity (Bangkok is consistently one of the most visited
            cities in the world), a vacation in Thailand is still relatively inexpensive.

            Straddling the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe in Mosi Oa Tunya National Park, Victoria Falls is
            roughly twice as deep and wide as Niagara Falls, making it one of the world's most jaw-dropping
            waterfalls.

        <h2>The Colosseum in Rome, Italy</h2>
        <p>Topping off the list of most popular tourist attractions is the Colosseum which is no big surprise for
            those with it on their bucket list.

            While a significant landmark in Rome, for those that have been & seen it in person, I must say that
            while impressive, it is not near as excellent a site as The Roman Forum </p>

        <h2>Victoria falls</h2>
        <p>Outdoorsy types travel far and wide to admire this breathtaking UNESCO World Heritage Site. Straddling
            the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe in Mosi Oa Tunya National Park, Victoria Falls is roughly twice
            as deep and wide as Niagara Falls, making it one of the world's most jaw-dropping waterfalls. To see
            this natural wonder at its prime, plan a visit in April or May when the region's rainy season has
            concluded. Popular vantage points include the Knife-Edge Bridge, Livingstone Island and Devil's Pool.
            When you're not enjoying the view from above, go whitewater rafting in the Zambezi River to admire the
            falls from a different angle.</p>
