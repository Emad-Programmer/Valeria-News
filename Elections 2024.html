        <h2>Donald Trump</h2>
        <p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at
            every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state's caucuses less than five weeks away.

        <h2>Joe Biden</h2>
        <p>Biden, like Hillary Clinton, got millions more votes nationwide than Trump, but Biden secured the White
            House in 2020 thanks to the thinnest of margins in a few key states Clinton lost in 2016.</p>

        <h2>Candidats</h2>
        <p>The Republican presidential candidates are all vying to take on President Joe Biden in November 2024. But
            first, they’re competing in the GOP primaries and caucuses, which begin in January, to emerge as the
            party’s nominee. The candidates are listed below in order of where they fall in Poll of Polls,
            which is an average of the four most recent nonpartisan, national surveys of either potential or likely
            2024 Republican primary voters that meet standards.</p>
