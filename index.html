        <h2>Breaking Bad</h2>
        <p>Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan for
            AMC. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an
            underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent
            diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student,
            Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial
            future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. Breaking Bad premiered
            on AMC on January 20, 2008, and concluded on September 29, 2013, after five seasons
            consisting of 62 episodes.</p>

        <h2>Victoria falls</h2>
        <p>Outdoorsy types travel far and wide to admire this breathtaking UNESCO World Heritage Site. Straddling
            the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe in Mosi Oa Tunya National Park, Victoria Falls is roughly twice
            as deep and wide as Niagara Falls, making it one of the world's most jaw-dropping waterfalls. To see
            this natural wonder at its prime, plan a visit in April or May when the region's rainy season has
            concluded. Popular vantage points include the Knife-Edge Bridge, Livingstone Island and Devil's Pool.
            When you're not enjoying the view from above, go whitewater rafting in the Zambezi River to admire the
            falls from a different angle.</p>
