        <p>Cut to 2023. Apple has spent the past three years upping the ante on power instead of design and as a
            result, the Mac has gotten boring again. Rather than shining a light on any exterior innovations this
            year, Apple recycled the chassis for the Mac Mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, focusing solely on pushing
            the boundaries of its house-made silicon and shattering any hopes that the iMac's most recent redo was
            the start of a new, vibrant era for Apple's machines.</p>

        <h2>Microsoft Dividend</h2>
        <p>Microsoft Rewards Shareholders with Quarterly Dividend:
            Microsoft announced its latest quarterly dividend, rewarding shareholders with a steady stream of
            income. The dividend of $0.62 per share reflects the company's strong financial performance and
            commitment to returning value to its investors. This news is likely to be welcomed by dividend-seeking
            investors and further boost confidence in Microsoft's long-term prospects.

        <h2>Apple Watch</h2>
        <p>American tech giant Apple has been granted a patent for an external flashlight feature on future Apple
            Watches, potentially revolutionising how users navigate in low-light conditions.

            While current models include an integrated flashlight that illuminates the display, the upcoming upgrade
            aims to introduce a dedicated external flashlight on the watch bands, according to GSM Arena.
